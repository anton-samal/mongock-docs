This section explains all the essential concepts required to understand how Mongock works and its usage. 

## Mongock structure 
Mongock requires 3 components to work: ChangeLogs, Driver and Runner:

### Changelog
Changelogs are your migration classes, where you implement your database changes. They represent a unit of a migration execution.

#### Migration
A Migration is the operation of taking ChangeLogs and applying them safely in order to perform the desired changes in the target system (usually a database). As we'll see in coming sections, there are other operations, but the migration is the main one. The other operations help the management of migrations, such as **undo** or **list**.

#### Change entry
Mongock persists the ChangeLogs in the database. A change entry is the representation of a change in the database. This allows tracking the status of the ChangeLog executions - identifying which have been executed and which are pending to be applied.  


### Driver
This component represents the persistence layer connection type to the database. Everything that needs to be persisted(distributed lock, change entries, etc.) are passed by the driver. In a nutshell, the driver connects to the target Database type.
Although Mongock was initially conceived only for MongoDB, it has grown and now provides drivers for other NoSQL as well SQL.   

### Runner
This component orchestrates the changelogs from the framework executed and injects them to the Runner. It is the glue that put everything together and makes it work. Itâ€™s responsible for the environment aspect(framework, etc.), takes the changeLogs and, with the help of the driver and other smaller components, loops and executes all Changelogs.

#### Builder
This component is used to build the Runner component by applying the relevant configuration and driver to the runner. It is tightly coupled with the runner.

## Mongock Architecture
The next diagram shows how Mongock works with the three main type of objects: ChangeLogs, driver and runner - and how these can be used by injecting different configurations in your Java Application:
