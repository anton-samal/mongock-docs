Mongock is set up in a few steps, which will be explained briefly in this section and more detailed in the rest of the documentation:
Importing artifact dependencies(maven, gradle, etc.)
Mongock's bom
Mongock's runner
Mongock's driver
MongoDB driver or specific underlying  library
Configure and run Mongock: Annotation approach or traditional builder approach
All the steps in group 1(importing artifact dependencies) are common independently of the approach you use(annotation or builder).
